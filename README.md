# 🦊 hi. yes. hello.

I'm **Jarrett Dominic**, also known as [@FlooffyKitsune](https://github.com/FlooffyKitsune). I write code. Sometimes intentionally.

I design and build things for the web. Some of them even work.  
You can see a few of them here:

## ⚒️ Tech I Use to Build, Break, and Blame Things

### 🧠 Languages I've Argued With Successfully:

[![Languages](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,js,ts,java,html,css,php,lua)](https://skillicons.dev)

> No, I will not write C. Yes, even if you ask nicely.

### 🔮 Frameworks I Keep Gaslighting Into Functionality:

[![Frameworks](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=svelte,react,nextjs,nuxtjs)](https://skillicons.dev)

> Don't ask how I made it work. I won't remember either.

### 🌀 Platforms I Deploy To and Immediately Regret:

[![Cloud Platforms](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=vercel,aws,firebase,netlify)](https://skillicons.dev)

> "It works on my machine" – me, moments before Vercel said *no*.

### 🧪 Databases I Swear I Set Up Right This Time:

[![Databases](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=supabase,prisma,mongodb,postgres,mysql)](https://skillicons.dev)

> Databases are like relationships. I say I want structure, but I really just want Supabase to stop ghosting me during deploys.

### 🛠 Tools I Open, Panic In, and Close:

[![Tools](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=vscode,visualstudio,blender,ps,ai,github,git,nodejs,yarn,npm)](https://skillicons.dev)

> Yes, I know I used both npm and yarn. No, I won’t explain myself.
